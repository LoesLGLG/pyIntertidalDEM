# pyIntertidalDEM
pyIntertidalDEM is a set of libraries and procedures written in python to extract shorelines from spectral images using a sophisticated shoreline extraction algorithm.

These modules are developed in Python v3 environment and it is recommended to run the program in Python v3 rather than Python v2. Python v2 is going to be deprecated in 2020.

## Setup and Processing
Step 0: Download the source-code in a directory. You can install with `pip install .`
Step 1: Run depcheck.py for checking for library and dependency error checks
Step 2: See example_extract.py for a small example of extracting .zip archives
Step 3: See example_mask.py mask generation procedure.
Step 4: See example_analysis.py for example analysis setup.

# Documentation
Currently the program is documented at source level and strongly believed that 
the use of the program falls on the left side of the xkcd documentation spectram!
