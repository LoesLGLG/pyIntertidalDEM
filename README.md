# pyIntertidalDEM
pyIntertidalDEM is a set of libraries and procedures written in python to 
extract shorelines from spectral images using a sophisticated shoreline extraction
algorithm.

These modules are developed in Python v3 environment and it is recommended to run
the program in Python v3 rather than Python v2. 

## Setup and Processing
Step 1: Run depcheck.py for checking for library and dependency error checks

Step 2: See example.py for example analysis setup

## Documentation
Currently the program is documented at source level and strongly believed that
